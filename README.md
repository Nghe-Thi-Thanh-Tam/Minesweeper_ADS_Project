## About the Project

Minesweeper is a logic puzzle game. The game features a grid of clickable squares but there are bombs scattered randomly over the board. The purpose of this game is to open all the non-bomb squares. Our objective throughout making this game is to take better grasp on OOP knowledge and apply ASD techniques like stacks,..

## Built with: ***LibGDX***

## Features: 
*Besides basic logical game features, we've been adding some more features that can boost your experience*
* **Theme switching**: there are 2 themes (including light theme and dark theme) that you can switching while or before play the game
* **Undo**: undo button let you second chances when mistakenly open a bomb square (you can also undo even you opened non-bomb squares)
* **Chording**: When a number has the correct amount of flags around that squares, players can click on the number to open all the un-flagged squares around it

## Future plan:
There are uncompleted features and also some ideas that we wish to take on in the future:
* **Successful first click**: players' first move in the game will never be the bomb
* **Timer**
* **Record**: record and display players' fastest plays
* **Difficulty selection**: players will be able to select difficulty
